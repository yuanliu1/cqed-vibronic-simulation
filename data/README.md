## Data
Here is all the data that we generated for our project. It is divided into three sections:

### /benchmarks/
In the benchmarks folder we have our benchmark results for various fock levels, simulation shots, and trotter steps, across 5 different sets of simulation runs to get an averaged dataset. Additionally, we have included a spreadsheet on expected runtimes on a CPU (specifically Intel Xeon Gold 6130) to aid in execution. 

### /general/
Here, we have the raw data for our project, most of which were used in our paper. We've included the png and raw data output, the latter of which can be used to generate new graphs.

### /paper_figures/
In this folder we have the pdf versions of the graphs that we used in our paper.
