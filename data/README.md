## Data
Here is all the data that we generated for our project. It is divided into three sections:

### /benchmarks/
In the benchmarks folder we have our benchmark results for various fock levels, simulation shots, and trotter steps. We included the output for all of the runs, compiling them into a single spreadsheet to observe the changes. All benchmarks were based on a default setting of 2^3 fock levels, 10000 shots, and 100 steps per picosecond, with both amplitude damping and dephasing channels enabled, where we changed one variable at a time to see the effect it has on performance and simulation dynamics. We have also included a list of Hazel Cluster Hosts for reference - these can be cross-referenced with the output of the individual simulation runs to determine the system that performed the simulation. 

### /general/
Here, we have the raw data for our project, most of which were used in our paper. We've included the png and raw data output, the latter of which can be used to generate new graphs.

### /paper_figures/
In this folder we have the png and pdf versions of the graphs that we used in our paper.
